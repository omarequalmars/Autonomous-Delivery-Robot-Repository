# Autonomous-Delivery-Robot-Repository

This repository is for the software and documentation for the Autonomous Delivery robot, which is a BSc graduation project
by AASTMT students. The project thesis explores the team's journey and results in the development of an Indoor-Outdoor Autonomous Mobile RObot, developed for the purpose of delivery services.

It contains 3 different sections of folders concerning the software used:

Computer Vision Section: contains OpenCV Python code that has to do with Face Detection, Lane Detection, and QR Code-based identity verification

SLAM Navigation and Path Planning Section: contains C++ packages pertaining to high-level control sub-systems.

Control System: contains embedded-C code for implementing the robot's control system, in accordance with the designed controller.
